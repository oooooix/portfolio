- name: EMNIST-ByClass Classification
  description: Improved VGG-16 by adding batch normalization, PReLU function, and GAP layer to reach 87.49% accuracy
    after 50 epochs on EMNIST-ByClass dataset. The original VGG-16 (without using pretraining) can only reach under 
    80% after 50 epochs.

- name: Kickstarter Fundraising Predictor (Kaggle)
  description: Experimented logistic regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbour, and support vector machine to build
    a predictor model on Kickstarter project outcomes, i.e. success or failure. After fine-tuning on 380k records using
    gridsearch and k-fold cross validaiton, random forest reached 99.18% accuracy.
