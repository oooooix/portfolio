# Personalized Intro - Personal branding theme for developers

Intro is an open source [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) theme built specially for developers.

## Usage
A few modifications have been done to the original repo.
The theme is imported from the local theme, instead of the officially hosted theme. Thus, to run this, in `gatsby-theme-intro` and `site` run
```bash
yarn install
```
Then, in `site` run
```bash
gatsby develop
```
